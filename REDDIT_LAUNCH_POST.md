# I built BackupGuardian: Stop trusting "good" database backups that fail during critical migrations

**TL;DR:** Created a tool that validates database backups by actually restoring them in Docker containers, not just syntax checking. Web app + CLI. Would love your feedback!

---

**The 3 AM Horror Story:**

Ever had a backup file that looked perfect, passed all syntax checks, but completely failed when you actually needed it during a production migration? Yeah, me too. Last time it happened, I spent 6 hours at 3 AM trying to figure out why a "validated" PostgreSQL backup was missing half the foreign key constraints.

That's when I realized most backup validation tools just check SQL syntax - they don't actually try to restore the damn thing.

## What I Built

**BackupGuardian** actually spins up fresh Docker containers and restores your entire backup to see what breaks. It's like having a staging environment specifically for testing your backup files.

🔗 **Live demo:** https://www.backupguardian.org  
🔗 **GitHub:** https://github.com/pasika26/backupguardian

## How it works:

1. Upload your `.sql`, `.dump`, or `.backup` file
2. It creates an isolated Docker container 
3. Actually restores your backup completely
4. Analyzes the restored database vs the original
5. Gives you a detailed report with a 0-100 migration confidence score
6. Cleans up the container

## CLI for CI/CD Integration:

```bash
# Install
npm install -g backup-guardian

# Validate any backup
backup-guardian validate backup.sql

# Get JSON for automation  
backup-guardian validate backup.sql --json
```

Perfect for adding to your deployment pipeline to catch backup issues before they hit production.

## What makes it different:

- **Actually restores** the backup (not just syntax checking)
- **Real Docker isolation** - no interference with your system
- **Multi-database support** - PostgreSQL, MySQL (MongoDB coming)
- **Detailed reporting** - PDF/JSON with actionable recommendations
- **Risk scoring** - Tells you exactly how confident you should be
- **Team collaboration** - Share validation history

## Tech Stack:

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** React + Vite  
- **CLI:** Commander.js with analytics
- **Infrastructure:** Railway + Vercel
- **Magic:** Docker for isolated testing

## Real Example Output:

```
✅ VALIDATION PASSED - HIGH CONFIDENCE
Your backup is ready for restoration.

📊 Backup Quality Score: 95/100
✅ File Integrity     (25/25) - No corruption detected
✅ SQL Structure      (25/25) - Valid syntax  
✅ Data Completeness  (25/25) - All transactions complete
✅ Compatibility      (20/25) - Minor dialect considerations

🎯 Migration Risk: LOW
```

## Why I built this:

Got tired of backup validation tools that give false confidence. If you're going to trust a backup for a critical migration, shouldn't you actually test that it restores properly?

Plus, I wanted something that could integrate into CI/CD pipelines so teams can catch backup issues automatically.

## Current status:

- ✅ Web interface working
- ✅ CLI tool functional  
- ✅ PostgreSQL + MySQL support
- ✅ Admin dashboard with analytics
- 🚧 MongoDB support (coming soon)
- 🚧 Scheduled validation jobs (roadmap)

## What I'm looking for:

1. **Try it out** with your backup files - what breaks?
2. **Feedback** on the validation logic - am I missing important checks?
3. **Feature requests** - what would make this actually useful for your workflow?
4. **Database priorities** - which database should I tackle next?

## Questions I have for you:

- Do you currently validate backups? How?
- What's the biggest backup disaster you've experienced?
- Would you use this in your CI/CD pipeline?
- What's missing that would make this a must-have tool?

I know there are other backup tools out there, but I couldn't find anything that actually tests restoration in isolated environments. Most just parse SQL files and call it good.

Would love to hear your thoughts, especially if you've been burned by "good" backups before!

*Built this because validation should mean actually testing, not just syntax checking.*
