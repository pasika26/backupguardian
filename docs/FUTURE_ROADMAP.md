## üí° **Feature Prioritization Criteria**

Features will be prioritized based on:

1. **User feedback** from MVP usage
2. **Revenue potential** and pricing tier fit
3. **Technical complexity** vs. business value
4. **Market demand** and competitive pressure
5. **Platform stability** and maintenance overhead

## üîÑ **Feedback Integration**

We'll use MVP user feedback to validate which enterprise features to build first:

- **Most requested** features get fast-tracked
- **Unused** features get reconsidered or removed
- **New use cases** discovered get added to roadmap
- **Performance bottlenecks** get priority fixes

This roadmap ensures we build enterprise features that users actually want and will pay for, rather than features we assume they need.
