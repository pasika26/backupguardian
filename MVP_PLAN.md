- [ ] **Optional Email Sharing** - Send results to team member email *(depends: Report Download)*

*Dependencies: All core features working*

## MVP Success Metrics (Solo User Focused)
- [ ] Upload and validate 1 PostgreSQL backup successfully without signup
- [ ] Complete end-to-end flow: Upload â†’ Auto-detect â†’ Validate â†’ Results â†’ Download Report
- [ ] Handle 3 different backup formats (.sql, .dump, custom) with auto-detection
- [ ] Process tests within 15 minutes for typical backups (<50MB)
- [ ] Generate actionable reports with migration readiness score (0-100)
- [ ] Support re-validation workflow for iterative improvement

## Post-MVP Features (Moved to Future Roadmap)
*See [`docs/FUTURE_ROADMAP.md`](docs/FUTURE_ROADMAP.md) for complete enterprise feature planning*

### **V2: Multi-Database Support**
- [x] **MySQL Support Structure** - Factory pattern ready, implementation framework complete
- [ ] **MySQL Complete Implementation** - Finish restore logic and validation
- [ ] **MongoDB Support** - Document database backup validation

### **V3: Team & Enterprise Features** (Deferred from MVP)
- [ ] **Team Collaboration** - Multi-user workspace features
- [ ] **Authentication & User Management** - Account system and permissions
- [ ] **Dashboard & History** - Test history and analytics
- [ ] **Slack/Discord Integrations** - Team notifications
- [ ] **Infrastructure Integration** - AWS/Azure direct connections
- [ ] **Scheduling & Automation** - Automated recurring tests
- [ ] **Advanced Reporting** - Historical analytics and trends
- [ ] **Compliance Audit Trails** - Enterprise compliance features
- [ ] **API for Programmatic Access** - REST API for automation

## Developer Traction Strategies
- [ ] **Open Source Core** - Release validation engine as OSS, premium for dashboard/scheduling
- [ ] **CLI Tool** - Simple `backup-guardian validate dump.sql` command developers can try instantly
- [ ] **GitHub Integration** - Actions/hooks to validate backups in CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] **Developer Communities** - Share on r/PostgreSQL, HackerNews, dev.to with "backup horror stories"

## Technical Architecture (Simplified MVP)
```

### New Architecture Components
- **Database Abstraction Layer**: Factory pattern for multi-database support
- **Auto-Detection Engine**: Intelligent backup file analysis
- **Testing Framework**: Jest integration with comprehensive coverage
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based database configuration

## Development Workflow & Testing

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all tests (unit + integration)
npm test

# Run tests with coverage reporting
npm run test:coverage

# Run unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# Individual test files
npm run test:docker        # Docker integration tests
npm run test:restore       # Restore automation tests
npm run test:validator     # Backup validator tests
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Backend setup with testing
cd backend
npm install
npm run db:migrate         # Setup application database
npm run db:seed           # Seed test data
npm test                  # Verify all tests pass
npm run dev              # Start development server

# Frontend setup
cd frontend  
npm install
npm run dev              # Start frontend dev server
```

### Database Development
```bash
# Test database abstraction
node test-database-abstraction.js

# Test backup validation integration
node test-backup-validation-integration.js

# Test with different database types
POSTGRES_TEST_BASE_PORT=5500 npm test
MYSQL_TEST_BASE_PORT=3400 npm test
```

## Risk Mitigation
- **Security**: Isolated test environments, no permanent backup storage
- **Performance**: Limit concurrent tests, file size limits, container resource limits
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling, test timeouts, automatic cleanup
- **Scalability**: Queue-based processing, horizontal scaling ready, database abstraction
- **Testing**: Comprehensive Jest coverage, integration tests, legacy compatibility
